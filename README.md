P.s. Hosted project is most luckily asleep due to inactivity (ws server is hosted on Render), so it takes a couple of minutes for it to come back up and work :)

## Project Setup

```sh
npm i
```

## Start server

```sh
npm run start:server
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Enjoy
